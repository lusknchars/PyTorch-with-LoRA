##LoRA with PyTorch
This notebook demonstrates how to implement Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fine-tuning large neural networks efficiently using PyTorch. It provides a clear, modular approach to applying LoRA on pre-trained transformer-based models while minimizing computational cost and memory footprint.

## Overview

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique that injects trainable low-rank matrices into existing model weights to adapt pre-trained models to new tasks without retraining all parameters.
This notebook walks through:

Setting up the environment for LoRA fine-tuning in PyTorch.

Integrating LoRA layers into a transformer model.

Training, validation, and evaluation workflows.

Comparing parameter efficiency vs. full fine-tuning.

## Contents
Section	Description
1. Setup	Import libraries, define dependencies, and configure GPU/CPU.
2. Model Preparation	Load a pre-trained model (e.g., from transformers) and insert LoRA adapters.
3. LoRA Implementation	Implement LoRA modules and attach them to specific layers.
4. Training Loop	Fine-tune the model using a custom dataset or preloaded data.
5. Evaluation	Compare metrics such as loss, accuracy, or perplexity.
6. Inference	Demonstrate the use of the adapted model in downstream tasks.
ðŸ§© Key Features

Compatible with PyTorch >= 2.0

Supports integration with Hugging Face Transformers

Minimal additional parameters (LoRA rank-controlled)

Optimized for GPU fine-tuning and memory efficiency

## Requirements
pip install torch torchvision transformers datasets accelerate peft

## Example Usage
# Load pre-trained model
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Apply LoRA adapters
from peft import get_peft_model, LoraConfig, TaskType
config = LoraConfig(
    task_type=TaskType.CAUSAL_LM,
    r=8, lora_alpha=32, lora_dropout=0.1
)
model = get_peft_model(model, config)

## Results and Insights

Significant parameter reduction with minimal accuracy loss.

LoRA achieved faster convergence compared to full fine-tuning.

Ideal for limited GPU environments or domain adaptation tasks.
